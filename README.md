# Cocaine Coast: The 1980s Coast Guard SES Timeline

An interactive historical timeline documenting the U.S. Coast Guard's War on Drugs during the 1980s, featuring the revolutionary Surface Effect Ship (SES) program and the intertwined stories of two Coast Guard officers: LT Jim Howe and RADM Wayne Justice.

![Timeline Preview](./preview.png)

## 📖 About

In the 1980s, South Florida became the front line of America's War on Drugs. As the "Cocaine Cowboys" flooded the U.S. with narcotics, the Coast Guard deployed a radical new weapon: the Surface Effect Ship—a high-speed, air-cushion vessel capable of catching the fastest "go-fast" boats used by smugglers.

This project chronicles the history of the SES Division based in Key West, Florida, and tells the story of the elite crews who operated these experimental vessels during one of the most intense periods of drug interdiction in U.S. history.

## 👥 Key Personnel

### LT Jim Howe
**Executive Officer, "Red Crew" (1982-1985)**

Jim Howe served as XO of the Red Crew, one of four rotating crews operating the SES fleet. His first-hand account, *Red Crew: Fighting the War on Drugs with Reagan's Coast Guard*, provides an insider's perspective on high-speed drug interdiction operations during the peak of the cocaine trade. His crew personally interdicted approximately 18 vessels during his tenure.

### RADM Wayne Justice
**Commanding Officer, Multiple Commands**

Wayne Justice, a 1977 Coast Guard Academy graduate, commanded the USCGC SHEARWATER (WSES-3) during the early SES operations and later served as CO of USCGC CAPE SHOALWATER. His career exemplifies the Coast Guard's multi-decade commitment to drug interdiction, with career seizures totaling over 140 tons of narcotics. He eventually became Chief of Law Enforcement for the Seventh District, shaping interdiction policy.

## 🚢 The Surface Effect Ship (SES)

### What is an SES?

The Surface Effect Ship is a hybrid vessel combining features of both a catamaran and a hovercraft. It rides on a cushion of air trapped between two hulls, dramatically reducing water friction and enabling speeds exceeding 30 knots—fast enough to catch smuggler "go-fast" boats.

### The SES Fleet

Three vessels were acquired in Summer 1982:
- **USCGC SEA HAWK (WSES-2)**
- **USCGC SHEARWATER (WSES-3)**
- **USCGC PETREL (WSES-4)**

A fourth vessel, USCGC DORADO (WSES-1), was used for testing in 1981-1982.

### Multi-Crewing Concept

To maximize operational time, four 16-person crews (Red, Blue, Green, and Gold) rotated among the three vessels. This innovative approach kept at least two ships at sea at all times while the third underwent maintenance.

## 📅 Historical Timeline

### Late 1970s - Early 1980s
The "Cocaine Cowboys" era begins. South Florida becomes the primary entry point for marijuana and cocaine smuggling, overwhelming traditional law enforcement.

### 1981-1982
The Coast Guard tests the DORADO and proves the SES concept viable for drug interdiction.

### November 1, 1982
**SES Division established in Key West, Florida**—marking the beginning of the elite unit's operations.

### 1982-1985
Peak operations. The SES fleet conducts hundreds of interdictions, including major operations like Wagonwheel and Hat Trick. Both Howe and Justice serve in overlapping roles during this period.

### Mid-1980s
Smugglers shift from bulky marijuana to high-value, low-volume cocaine in response to successful interdictions.

### Late 1980s - 1990s
The SES program winds down due to high maintenance costs and evolving threats. Both officers transition to larger commands and policy roles.
